The portfolio has to be built using HTML 5 semantic elements, divs and a CSS3 file. Both CSS3 and HTML5 must be validated using the W3C validators. Please include screenshots of validation.
The HTML pages should contain JavaScript for handling interactions and events. The portfolio should be displayed correctly both on most common browsers (chrome, Firefox, safari) and mobile devices (e.g., android mobiles, iPad, iPhones, etc.).

The portfolio must include the following sections:
* In each html page you design, your student number, name and surname must be in the 'title' tag
* Personal statement (a couple of hundred words)
* A list of experiences (each containing the position covered, the employer (company/university), the starting and ending dates (or current)
* A list of skills (keywords such as 'mobile development', 'CSS', 'JavaScript', 'machine learning' etc.)
* Education (a list of titles each containing the awarding body, the starting and ending dates (or current))
* A list of personal interests (e.g. sport, music, etc.)
* A list of honours and awards (each containing the awarding body and the date)
* The above sections can be coded in different HTML pages and linked in a menu. Third-party libraries cannot be used, apart from Twitter Bootstrap, which can be used for layout
